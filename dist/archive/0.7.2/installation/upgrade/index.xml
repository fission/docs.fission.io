      <description>TL;DR The Fission API has changed significantly in this version. The new API is incompatible with the old one. The CLI is compatible; if you wrote scripts using it, those should still work.
Below we describe a tool for migrating your state from your old install to the new one.
While this upgrade is going to be disruptive, we&amp;rsquo;re going to do our best to make sure future upgrades aren&amp;rsquo;t as bad.</description>

      <description>Introduction Kubernetes ThirdPartyResources (&amp;ldquo;TPR&amp;rdquo;) are replaced by CustomResourceDefinitions (&amp;ldquo;CRD&amp;rdquo;). TPRs have been deprecated and are removed in Kubernetes 1.8.
Since Fission stores state in TPRs, we need to migrate this state from TPRs to CRDs while upgrading.
Follow the instructions below if you&amp;rsquo;re upgrading a Fission 0.2.1 or 0.3.0 cluster to 0.4. If you&amp;rsquo;re using a pre-0.2 Fission cluster, use the [upgrade guide from 0.1 to 0.2]() and then upgrade to 0.</description>
