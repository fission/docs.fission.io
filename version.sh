# Keep this version updated to the latest release (would be super nice
# to do this automatically with the github api!)
#
# Before changing this version, build the site manually (run build.sh)
# and git add/commit/push the resulting dist/$VERSION directory.  This
# ensures that links to the docs of older versions don't break.
