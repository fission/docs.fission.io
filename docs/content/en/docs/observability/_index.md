# Observability using logs and metrics

Fission exposes metrics which can be used scraped using [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) and visualized using a tool like [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana). Metrics can also be constructed over Fission logs using a tool like [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki).
