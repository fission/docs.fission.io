## Features

#### Support for Keda 2.0

From this release, the message queue trigger of `--mqtkind keda`, supports `Keda 2.0` we won't be supporting `Keda 1.5`. Checkout out [compatibility page](https://docs.fission.io/docs/compatibility) for more details.

#### Multi-Architecture Build

Thanks to [cerebrate](https://github.com/cerebrateNow), now you can deploy [fission on ARM architecture](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1891).

## Fixes

* We did a couple of optimizations around choosing the ready pods for specialization by introducing a controller and a queue to avoiding a costly call to k8s API every single time specialization request comes. After the changes, we were able to scale up to 7.5K RPM from 4.8K RPM for long-running functions. In our load test, we used functions having execution time of 15s, 45s, 75s, 90s, and 120s. [Link to functions samples](https://github.com/fission/examples/tree/master/samples/long-running-compute). Refer to [PR](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1860)

* Improved scale performance issue when pool size is smaller than request burst by changing queue implementation strategy. [Issue](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1883) | [Fix](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1890)

* When using `fission spec apply`, spec validations are now made optional which performance by twice. [Issue link](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1694) | [Fix](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1865)

* Earlier when the number of requests exceeded the value of the `concurrency` parameter, 502 HTTP status code was propagated to the user. Now, instead 499 HTTP status code would be propagated. [Issue](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1875) | [Fix](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1924)

* When a function(new deploy strategy) and environment were deployed in a different namespace, changes made environments weren't reflected in the function pod. Now, this is fixed. [Issue](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1848) | [Fix](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1866)

* While working with `fission spec apply --wait` build status of package wasn't checked, this has been fixed now and `exit code 1` is returned on the failure of a package build. [Issue](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1881) | [Fix](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1926)

* Replaced clusterRole `cluster-admin` with a less permissive role. [Issue](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1845) | [Fix](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1867)

* Thanks to [chenjr0719](https://github.com/chenjr0719), now error message is put to error topic only after max retries in Kafka MQT of `--mqtkind fission`. [Issue](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1882) | [Fix](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1885)
