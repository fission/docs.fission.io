## Features

#### Support for Keda 2.0

From this release, message queue trigger of `--mqtkind keda`, supports `Keda 2.0` we won't be supporting `Keda 1.5`. Checkout out [compatibility page](https://docs.fission.io/docs/compatibility) for more details.

#### Multi-Architecture Build

Thanks to [cerebrate](https://github.com/cerebrateNow), now you can deploy [fission on ARM architecture](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1891).

## Fixes

* We did a couple of optimizations around choosing the readyPod for specialization by introducing a controller and a queue to avoiding an costly call to k8s API every single time specialization request comes. After the changes we were able to scale upto 7.5K RPM from 4.8K RPM for long running functions. In our load test, we used functions having execution time of 15s, 45s, 75s, 90s and 120s. [Link to functions samples](https://github.com/fission/examples/tree/master/samples/long-running-compute). Refer to [PR](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1860)

* Improved scale performance issue when poolsize is smaller than request burst by changing queue implementation stragegy.[issue](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1883) [fix](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1890)

* When using `fission spec apply`, spec validations are now made optional which performance by twice. [issue](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1694) [fix](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1865)

* Earlier when the number of requests exceeded the value of `concurrency` parameter, 502 HTTP status code was propagated to user. Now, instead 499 HTTP status code would be propagted. [issue](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1875) [fix](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1924)

* When function(new deploy strategy) and envirnoments were deployed in different namespace, changes made environments weren't reflected in function pod. Now, this is fixed. [issue](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1848) [fix](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1866)

* While working with `fission spec apply --wait` build status of package wasn't checked, this has been fixed now and `exit code 1` is returned on failure of package build. [issue](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1881) [fix](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1926)

* Replaced clusterRole `cluster-admin` with less permissive role [issue](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1845) [fix](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1867)

* Thanks to [chenjr0719](https://github.com/chenjr0719), now error message is put to error topic only after max retries in Kafka MQT of `--mqtkind fission`. [issue](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1882) [fix](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1885)
