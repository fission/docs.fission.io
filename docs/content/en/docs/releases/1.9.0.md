### Go 1.14 support

Go 1.14 environment images are now online, thanks a lot for adding this [Jared](https://github.com/Jared-Prime)

### Function Level timeout

Now you can configure timeout at function level for long running functions, appreciate this feature [Ta-Ching](https://github.com/life1347)

### External Nats streaming

You can now configure a external Nats server instead of using the one shipped with Fission, thank you so much [Shaun](https://github.com/shaunc)

### PodSecurityPolicy for Logger

A new PodSecurityPolicy can be now added and configured for logger pods.
Some installations in environments such as OpenShift will find this useful.
