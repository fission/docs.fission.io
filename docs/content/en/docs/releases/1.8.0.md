```

### Resource setting for fetcher

Now you are able to configure fetcher resource setting before helm installation.

{{% notice warning %}}
Fetcher is for downloading or uploading archive.</br>
Low resource `limits` will increase the function specialization time and make specialization timeout.</br>
Normally, you don't need to change the default value, unless necessary.
{{% /notice %}}

```yaml
fetcher:
  image: fission/fetcher
  imageTag: 1.8.0
  resource:
    cpu:
      requests: "10m"
      limits: ""
    mem:
      requests: "16Mi"
      limits: ""
```
