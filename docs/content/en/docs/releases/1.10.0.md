# Features

## S3 as a backend for Storage Service

The storage service had option of persistent volume only to store code but this release adds support for S3 compatiable storage as a backend for storage service. Thanks a lot for this change [Alok](https://github.com/rajalokan)

## Disabling env variable based discovery in Functions

Many multi tenant systems want to minimize the information exposed to functions. With Kubernetes's traditional DNS - addresses of other pods are exposed as env variables. [This change makes it configurable](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1599) based on your needs, thanks a lot to https://github.com/darkworon

## Kube Context flag in Fission CLI

Now you can switch the [Kube context from Fission CLI](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1595), thanks a lot [Rahul](https://github.com/therahulbhati)


# Fixes!

* An upstream change in pip for Python3 [needed change in Python env](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1633), thanks [Pooja](https://github.com/agiwalpooja20) for this fix.

* When you create a package for first time for a given environment, and if the builder pod is not ready by then the package build would fail. [This fix](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/1614) adds a exponential backoff and waits till 5 minutes before eventually failing. Thanks for this one [Rahul](https://github.com/rahulchheda)
