## Features

#### Support for prefix-based routes for functions

We can forward all request matching a particular prefix to the function which supports routing internally. This enables different functions which can handle multiple requests with prefix route. Here's an example you can try out: [Nextjs example]( https://github.com/fission/examples/tree/master/samples/nextjs-prefixpath )

#### Support for multiple HTTP verbs for a function

Fission support only one HTTP verb per request route. Now we enable multiple HTTP verbs per route. The same function now can serve GET, POST or different types of requests. Here's an example you can try out: [Nextjs example]( https://github.com/fission/examples/tree/master/samples/nextjs-prefixpath )

#### Added ImagePullPolicy and PodSpec for KEDA connector deployments

ImagePullPolicy and PodSpec are parameters which can be used to control the Kubernetes deployment of pods which used by KEDA connector. For example, with PodSpec, taints and toleration would be possible, similar to [this](https://docs.fission.io/docs/spec/podspec/toleration/) can be done. You can learn more about Pod Spec [here](https://docs.fission.io/docs/spec/). If you want to try PodSpec in MQT, you can check this example [out](https://github.com/fission/examples/tree/master/samples/kafka-keda/specs).

#### RequestsPerPod and OnceOnly fields are added for pool manager

RequestsPerPod will denote how many requests will be routed to each pod in Pool Manager.
OnceOnly is similar to a Kubernetes Job, it is useful in long-running tasks where only one request is served by one pod. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.fission.io/docs/usage/executor/)

#### Websocket support for reaping

With recent changes in the NodeJS environment for websocket, conventional timeout based reaping wasn't applicable so an event-based reaping mechanism to support Websocket was introduced. You can try out the example [here](https://github.com/fission/examples/tree/master/samples/websocket) 

#### Performance improvements in Router with SharedInformer

We have added SharedInformer's for querying different Kubernetes objects in the router. Few of the Kubernetes objects were getting queried on function request, adding SharedInformer helps in improving performance.

## Note

* We have changed installation steps, please refer latest installation steps. You need to install Custom Resource Definitions(CRDs) before installing Helm chart.
* Environments releases are decoupled from Fission release. Environments would be updated separately from Fission releases.

## Deprecation

* We have deprecated `Spec.Method` in HTTPTrigger, please use `Spec.Methods` instead.
